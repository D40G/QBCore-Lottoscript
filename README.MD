First of all **DONT** rename the folder (lotto).
just upload the lotto into your recources.
Add **start lotto** into your **server.cfg**

ADD THIS INTO YOUR **shared.lua** (in your qb-core folder)

```
["lotto"] = {
  ["name"] = "lotto",
  ["label"] = "Lotto ticket",
  ["weight"] = 10,
  ["type"] = "item", 
  ["image"] = "lotto.png",
  ["unique"] = false, 
  ["useable"] = true, 
  ["shouldClose"] = true,  
  ["combinable"] = nil,  
  ["description"] = "Lucky Ticket"},
 ```


Upload the **lotto.png**  into your **inventory/html/images** folder
